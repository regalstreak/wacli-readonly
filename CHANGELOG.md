# Changelog

## 0.7.0 - Unreleased (read-only fork)

This release pulls upstream **wacli 0.7.0** changes into the read-only fork. All send/write commands added upstream (`send text`, `send file`, `send react`, `presence typing/paused`, `groups rename/participants/invite/join/leave`, `contacts refresh/alias/tags`) are **intentionally not registered** in this fork. Write methods at the `wa.Client` layer return errors unconditionally (defense-in-depth).

### Read-only fork specifics

- Remove `--read-only`/`WACLI_READONLY` flag — this fork is read-only by design, not by flag.
- Remove all write command registrations (`send`, `presence`, `groups rename/participants/invite/join/leave`).
- Stub `SendText`, `SendProtoMessage`, `SendReaction`, `Upload`, `SetGroupName`, `UpdateGroupParticipants`, `GetGroupInviteLink`, `JoinGroupWithLink`, `LeaveGroup`, `SendChatPresence` at the `wa.Client` layer.
- Default `WACLI_DEVICE_LABEL` to `Chrome` to blend in with normal Web sessions.
- Auth: add `--qr-file PATH` to save QR code as PNG (requires `qrencode`).
- Rename binary/project to `wacli-readonly`; default store dir is `~/.wacli-readonly`.

### Pulled from upstream 0.7.0

- CLI: add `--lock-wait` to wait for transient store locks before failing.
- CLI: add `--full` to disable table truncation; piped output now keeps full message IDs. (#13 — thanks @rickhallett)
- Diagnostics: show linked JID and local store counts in `auth status` and `doctor`. (#149 — thanks @draix)
- Messages: add `messages list --sender`, `--from-me`, `--from-them`, and `--asc` filters. (#153 — thanks @draix)
- Messages: add `messages search --has-media`, `--type text`, case-insensitive media types, and validation for contradictory filters. (#128 — thanks @ImLukeF and @Mansehej)
- Messages: extract searchable/display text from WhatsApp Business templates, buttons, interactive messages, and list replies. (#79 — thanks @terry-li-hm)

### Security

- Auth: reject `?` and `#` in whatsmeow session store paths to avoid SQLite URI parameter injection. (#180 — thanks @shaun0927)
- Store: restrict index and session SQLite database files to owner-only permissions. (#147 — thanks @draix)

### Fixed

- Groups: hide groups after `groups leave`, mark missing joined groups as left during refresh, and show them again if a later refresh reports membership. (#125, #129 — thanks @SeifBenayed and @ImLukeF)
- History: cap on-demand backfill at 500 messages per request and 100 requests per run.
- Messages: normalize device-specific `@s.whatsapp.net` JIDs before storing chats, contacts, and senders.
- Doctor: report lock owner PID and distinguish paired stores locked by another process. (#105 — thanks @artemgetmann)
- Media: recover panics per download job so one bad payload no longer drains the worker pool. (#179 — thanks @shaun0927)
- Messages: attribute history messages from LID-addressed groups to the top-level participant sender. (#19 — thanks @entropyy0)
- Messages: show display text for replies, reactions, and media in `messages context`. (#183 — thanks @fuleinist)
- Send: strip a leading `+` from phone-number recipients before building WhatsApp JIDs. (#74 — thanks @FrederickStempfle)
- Search: keep FTS5 enabled after reopening existing databases with already-applied migrations. (#185 — thanks @iamhitarth)
- Send: add `send text --reply-to` for quoted replies, with sender inference for synced group messages. (#154 — thanks @draix)
- Send: bound send attempts and reconnect once for stale-session/time-out failures instead of hanging indefinitely. (#115 — thanks @0xatrilla)
- Send: persist retry-message plaintext so linked devices can decrypt retried messages. (#186 — thanks @SimDamDev)
- Store: use the XDG state directory on Linux by default, while keeping existing `~/.wacli` stores working. (#172, #164 — thanks @txhno)
- Sync: keep `sync --once` idle timing focused on message/history events so connection chatter cannot hang exit. (#119 — thanks @jyothepro)
- Sync: start `sync --once` idle timing after the `Connected` event. (#171 — thanks @fuleinist)
- Sync: include event type, stack trace, and recovery count when logging recovered event-handler panics. (#181 — thanks @shaun0927)
- Sync: apply bounded backpressure to media download enqueueing instead of spawning unbounded overflow goroutines. (#121 — thanks @jyothepro)
- Windows: split store locking by platform so the lock package compiles on Windows. (#188 — thanks @dinakars777)

### Docs

- Maintainers: add CODEOWNERS and maintainer contact info.

### Chore

- CI: compile-test the Windows lock package to catch platform regressions. (#188 — thanks @dinakars777)
- Dependencies: update Go modules including `whatsmeow`, `go-sqlite3`, `x/*`, and related runtime libs.
- Refactor: split WhatsApp message parsing into focused text, media, business, and context helpers.
- Refactor: inject clocks in app/store paths for deterministic tests.
- Version: bump CLI version string to `0.7.0`.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-04-14

### Security

- Search: sanitize FTS5 user queries and escape LIKE wildcards to avoid query-syntax injection.
- Store: reject SQLite URI path injection via `?` and `#`, guard empty table names, and strip null/control chars from sanitized paths.
- Sync: recover panics in event handlers and media workers instead of crashing the process.

### Fixed

- Sync: bound reconnect duration so long-running commands do not hold the store lock forever.
- CLI: force exit on a second SIGINT during long-running commands.

### Added

- Store: add `WACLI_STORE_DIR` to configure the default store directory.

### Chore

- Dependencies: bump `filippo.io/edwards25519`.

- Release: install arm64 libc headers in release workflow to improve ARM build reliability.

### Docs

- README: update usage/docs for the 0.2.0 release baseline.
